jblite: J-Ben SQLite parsing scripts
Copyright 2010 by Paul Goins

This library allows conversion of JMdict and KANJIDIC2 into SQLite
databases.  All "data" within the original files (that is, everything
except comments) should be preserved in the SQLite format.

Documentation is lacking right now, but a few notes:


Running the JMdict conversion tool:

    python -m jblite.jmdict <target.db> <JMdict|JMdict.gz>

Details about the SQL schema:

    jmdict.png or jmdict.dia: graph of the database layout


Running the KANJIDIC2 conversion tool:

    python -m jblite.kd2 <target.db> <KANJIDIC2|KANJIDIC2.gz>

No schema info yet, but it's far simpler than JMdict, so it shouldn't
be so hard to figure out.
