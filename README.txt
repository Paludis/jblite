jblite: J-Ben SQLite parsing scripts
Copyright 2010 by Paul Goins
Released under the two-clause OSI-approved BSD license (see COPYING.txt)


This library allows conversion of JMdict (or JMdict.gz) into an SQLite
database.  All "data" within JMdict (that is, everything except
comments) should be preserved in the SQLite format.

A converter for KANJIDIC2 is also in this package, but it is not
recommended.  I will be rewriting it when time allows.

Documentation is lacking right now, but a few notes:


Running the JMdict conversion tool:

    python -m jblite.jmdict <target.db> <JMdict|JMdict.gz>

Details about the SQL schema:

    jmdict.png or jmdict.dia: graph of the database layout
